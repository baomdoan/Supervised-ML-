# Supervised-ML-


This is assignment for my data science certificate program. 

This Machine learning method that will be using in this assignment is supervised learning model, namely Logistis Regression and Linear Regression.

The data that is using for Linear Regression is using the patient data with their medical history and to predict the amount of money that will be charge on them.

The data that is using for Logistic Regression is advertisement data, the main point is analysing the data and create a model to predict whether an individual will click on the ads based on the criteria and features that are given.
